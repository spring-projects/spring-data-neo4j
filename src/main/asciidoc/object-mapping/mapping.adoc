= Object Mapping

The following sections will explain the process of mapping between your graph and your domain.
It is split into two parts.
The first part explains the actual mapping and the available tools for you to describe how to map nodes, relationships and properties to objects.
The second part will have a look at Spring Data's object mapping fundamentals.
It gives valuable tips on general mapping, why you should prefer immutable domain objects and how you can model them with Java or Kotlin.

[[mapping.annotations]]
== Metadata-based Mapping

To take full advantage of the object mapping functionality inside SDN, you should annotate your mapped objects with the `@Node` annotation.
Although it is not necessary for the mapping framework to have this annotation (your POJOs are mapped correctly, even without any annotations), it lets the classpath scanner find and pre-process your domain objects to extract the necessary metadata.
If you do not use this annotation, your application takes a slight performance hit the first time you store a domain object, because the mapping framework needs to build up its internal metadata model so that it knows about the properties of your domain object and how to persist them.

[[mapping.annotations.overview]]
=== Mapping Annotation Overview

[[mapping.annotations.overview.from.sdn]]
==== From SDN

* `@Node`: Applied at the class level to indicate this class is a candidate for mapping to the database.
* `@Id`: Applied at the field level to mark the field used for identity purpose.
* `@GeneratedValue`: Applied at the field level together with `@Id` to specify how unique identifiers should be generated.
* `@Property`: Applied at the field level to modify the mapping from attributes to properties.
* `@CompositeProperty`: Applied at the field level on attributes of type Map that shall be read back as a composite. See <<custom.conversions.composite-properties>>.
* `@Relationship`: Applied at the field level to specify the details of a relationship.
* `@DynamicLabels`: Applied at the field level to specify the source of dynamic labels.
* `@RelationshipProperties`: Applied at the class level to indicate this class as the target for properties of a relationship.
* `@TargetNode`: Applied on a field of a class annotated with `@RelationshipProperties` to mark the target of that relationship from the perspective of the other end.

The following annotations are used to specify conversions and ensure backwards compatibility with OGM.

* `@DateLong`
* `@DateString`
* `@ConvertWith`

See <<conversions>> for more information on that.

[[mapping.annotations.overview.from.commons]]
==== From Spring Data commons

* `@org.springframework.data.annotation.Id` same as `@Id` from SDN, in fact, `@Id` is annotated with Spring Data Common's Id-annotation.
* `@CreatedBy`: Applied at the field level to indicate the creator of a node.
* `@CreatedDate`: Applied at the field level to indicate the creation date of a node.
* `@LastModifiedBy`: Applied at the field level to indicate the author of the last change to a node.
* `@LastModifiedDate`: Applied at the field level to indicate the last modification date of a node.
* `@PersistenceConstructor`: Applied at one constructor to mark it as the preferred constructor when reading entities.
* `@Persistent`: Applied at the class level to indicate this class is a candidate for mapping to the database.
* `@Version`: Applied at field level it is used for optimistic locking and checked for modification on save operations.
 The initial value is zero which is bumped automatically on every update.
* `@ReadOnlyProperty`: Applied at field level to mark a property as read only. The property will be hydrated during database reads,
 but not be subject to writes. When used on relationships be aware that no related entity in that collection will be persisted
 if not related otherwise.

Have a look at <<auditing>> for all annotations regarding auditing support.

[[mapping.annotations.node]]
=== The basic building block: `@Node`

The `@Node` annotation is used to mark a class as a managed domain class, subject to the classpath scanning by the mapping context.

To map an Object to nodes in the graph and vice versa, we need a label to identify the class to map to and from.

`@Node` has an attribute `labels` that allows you to configure one or more labels to be used when reading and writing instances of the annotated class.
The `value` attribute is an alias for `labels`.
If you don't specify a label, then the simple class name will be used as the primary label.
In case you want to provide multiple labels, you could either:

. Supply an array to the `labels` property.
The first element in the array will be considered as the primary label.
. Supply a value for `primaryLabel` and put the additional labels in `labels`.

The primary label should always be the most concrete label that reflects your domain class.

For each instance of an annotated class that is written through a repository or through the Neo4j template, one node in the graph with at least the primary label will be written.
Vice versa, all nodes with the primary label will be mapped to the instances of the annotated class.

==== A note on class hierarchies

The `@Node` annotation is not inherited from super-types and interfaces.
You can however annotate your domain classes individually at every inheritance level.
This allows polymorphic queries: You can pass in base or intermediate classes and retrieve the correct, concrete instance for your nodes.
This is only supported for abstract bases annotated with `@Node`.
The labels defined on such a class will be used as additional labels together with the labels of the concrete implementations.

We also support interfaces in domain-class-hierarchies for some scenarios:

.Domain model in a separate module, same primary label like the interface name
[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../../../src/test/java/org/springframework/data/neo4j/integration/shared/common/Inheritance.java[tag=interface1]
----
<.> Just the plain interface name, as you would name your domain
<.> As we need to synchronize the primary labels, we put `@Node` on the implementing class, which
    is probably in another module. Note that the value is exactly the same as the name of the interface
    implemented. Renaming is not possible.

Using a different primary label instead of the interface name is possible, too:

.Different primary label
[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../../../src/test/java/org/springframework/data/neo4j/integration/shared/common/Inheritance.java[tag=interface2]
----
<.> Put the `@Node` annotation on the interface

It's also possible to use different implementations of an interface and have a polymorph domain model.
When doing so, at least two labels are required: A label determining the interface and one determining the concrete class:

.Multiple implementations
[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../../../src/test/java/org/springframework/data/neo4j/integration/shared/common/Inheritance.java[tag=interface3]
----
<.> Explicitly specifying the label that identifies the interface is required in this scenario
<.> Which applies for the first…
<.> and second implementation as well
<.> This is a client or parent model, using `SomeInterface3` transparently for two relationships
<.> No concrete type is specified

The data structure needed is shown in the following test. The same would be written by the OGM:

.Data structure needed for using multiple, different interface implementations
[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../../../src/test/java/org/springframework/data/neo4j/integration/imperative/InheritanceMappingIT.java[tag=interface3]
----

NOTE: Interfaces cannot define an identifier field.
As a consequence they are not a valid entity type for repositories.

[[mapping.annotations.node.dynamic.labels]]
==== Dynamic or "runtime" managed labels

All labels implicitly defined through the simple class name or explicitly via the `@Node` annotation are static.
They cannot be changed during runtime.
If you need additional labels that can be manipulated during runtime, you can use `@DynamicLabels`.
`@DynamicLabels` is an annotation on field level and marks an attribute of type `java.util.Collection<String>` (a `List` or `Set`) for example) as source of dynamic labels.

If this annotation is present, all labels present on a node and not statically mapped via `@Node` and the class names, will be collected into that collection during load.
During writes, all labels of the node will be replaced with the statically defined labels plus the contents of the collection.

WARNING: If you have other applications add additional labels to nodes, don't use `@DynamicLabels`.
If `@DynamicLabels` is present on a managed entity, the resulting set of labels will be "the truth" written to the database.

[[mapping.annotations.id]]
=== Identifying instances: `@Id`

While `@Node` creates a mapping between a class and nodes having a specific label, we also need to make the connection between individual instances of that class (objects) and instances of the node.

This is where `@Id` comes into play.
`@Id` marks an attribute of the class to be the unique identifier of the object.
That unique identifier is in an optimal world a unique business key or in other words, a natural key.
`@Id` can be used on all attributes with a supported simple type.

Natural keys are however pretty hard to find.
Peoples names for example are seldom unique, change over time or worse, not everyone has a first and last name.

We therefore support two different kind of _surrogate keys_.

On an attribute of type `long` or `Long`, `@Id` can be used with `@GeneratedValue`.
This maps the Neo4j internal id, which is *not* a property on a node or relationship and usually not visible, to the attribute and allows SDN to retrieve individual instances of the class.

`@GeneratedValue` provides the attribute `generatorClass`.
`generatorClass` can be used to specify a class implementing `IdGenerator`.
An `IdGenerator` is a functional interface and its `generateId` takes the primary label and the instance to generate an Id for.
We support `UUIDStringGenerator` as one implementation out of the box.

You can also specify a Spring Bean from the application context on `@GeneratedValue` via `generatorRef`.
That bean also needs to implement `IdGenerator`, but can make use of everything in the context, including the Neo4j client or template to interact with the database.

NOTE: Don't skip the important notes about ID handling in <<mapping.id-handling>>

[[mapping.annotations.version]]
=== Optimistic locking: `@Version`

Spring Data Neo4j supports optimistic locking by using the `@Version` annotation on a `Long` typed field.
This attribute will get incremented automatically during updates and must not be manually modified.

If, e.g., two transactions in different threads want to modify the same object with version `x`, the first operation will get successfully persisted to the database.
At this moment, the version field will get incremented, so it is `x+1`.
The second operation will fail with a `OptimisticLockingFailureException` because it wants to modify the object with the version `x`
that does not exist anymore in the database.
In such cases the operation needs to get retried, beginning with a fresh fetch of the object with the current version from the database.

[[mapping.annotations.property]]
=== Mapping properties: `@Property`

All attributes of a `@Node`-annotated class will be persisted as properties of Neo4j nodes and relationships.
Without further configuration, the name of the attribute in the Java or Kotlin class will be used as Neo4j property.

If you are working with an existing Neo4j schema or just like to adapt the mapping to your needs, you will need to use `@Property`.
The `name` is used to specify the name of the property inside the database.

[[mapping.annotations.relationship]]
=== Connecting nodes: `@Relationship`

The `@Relationship` annotation can be used on all attributes that are not a simple type.
It is applicable on attributes of other types annotated with `@Node` or collections and maps thereof.

The `type` or the `value` attribute allow configuration of the relationship's type, `direction` allows specifying the direction.
The default direction in SDN is `Relationship.Direction#OUTGOING`.

We support dynamic relationships.
Dynamic relationships are represented as a `Map<String, AnnotatedDomainClass>` or `Map<Enum, AnnotatedDomainClass>`.
In such a case, the type of the relationship to the other domain class is given by the maps key and must not be configured through the `@Relationship`.

[[mapping.annotations.relationship.properties]]
==== Map relationship properties

Neo4j supports defining properties not only on nodes but also on relationships.
To express those properties in the model SDN provides `@RelationshipProperties` to be applied on a simple Java class.
Within the properties class there have to be exactly one field marked as `@TargetNode` to define the entity the relationship points towards.
Or, in an `INCOMING` relationship context, is coming from.

A relationship property class and its usage may look like this:

.Relationship properties `Roles`
[source,java]
----
include::../../../../src/test/java/org/springframework/data/neo4j/documentation/domain/Roles.java[tags=mapping.relationship.properties]
----

You must define a property for the generated, internal ID so that SDN can determine during save which relationships
can be safely overwritten without losing properties.
If SDN does not find a field for storing the internal node id, it will fail during startup.

NOTE: The only supported generated ID field on classes annotated with `@RelationshipProperties` is `@GeneratedValue` with
      using the default ID generator `InternalIdGenerator` as shown above. Other generators will lead to a failure during
      startup.

.Defining relationship properties for an entity
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../../../src/test/java/org/springframework/data/neo4j/documentation/domain/MovieEntity.java[tags=mapping.relationship.properties]
----

[[mapping.annotations.relationship.remarks]]
==== Relationship query remarks

In general there is no limitation of relationships / hops for creating the queries.
SDN parses the whole reachable graph from your modelled nodes.

This said, when there is the idea of mapping a relationship bidirectional, meaning you define the relationship on both ends of your entity,
you might get more than what you are expecting.

Consider an example where a _movie_ has _actors_, and you want to fetch a certain movie with all its actors.
This won't be problematical if the relationship from _movie_ to _actor_ were just unidirectional.
In a bidirectional scenario SDN would fetch the particular _movie_, its _actors_ but also the other movies defined for this _actor_ per definition of the relationship.
In the worst case, this will cascade to fetching the whole graph for a single entity.

[[mapping.annotations.example]]
=== A complete example

Putting all those together, we can create a simple domain.
We use movies and people with different roles:

.The `MovieEntity`
====
[source,java]
----
include::../../../../src/test/java/org/springframework/data/neo4j/documentation/domain/MovieEntity.java[tags=mapping.annotations]
----
<.> `@Node` is used to mark this class as a managed entity.
It also is used to configure the Neo4j label.
The label defaults to the name of the class, if you're just using plain `@Node`.
<.> Each entity has to have an id.
We use the movie's name as unique identifier.
<.> This shows `@Property` as a way to use a different name for the field than for the graph property.
<.> This configures an incoming relationship to a person.
<.> This is the constructor to be used by your application code as well as by SDN.
====

People are mapped in two roles here, `actors` and `directors`.
The domain class is the same:

[[mapping.complete-example.person]]
.The `PersonEntity`
====
[source,java]
----
include::../../../../src/test/java/org/springframework/data/neo4j/documentation/domain/PersonEntity.java[tags=mapping.annotations]
----
====

NOTE: We haven't modelled the relationship between movies and people in both direction.
Why is that?
We see the `MovieEntity` as the aggregate root, owning the relationships.
On the other hand, we want to be able to pull all people from the database without selecting all the movies associated with them.
Please consider your application's use case before you try to map every relationship in your database in every direction.
While you can do this, you may end up rebuilding a graph database inside your object graph and this is not the intention of a mapping framework.

[[mapping.id-handling]]
== Handling and provisioning of unique IDs

[[mapping.id-handling.internal-id]]
=== Using the internal Neo4j id

The easiest way to give your domain classes a unique identifier is the combination of `@Id` and `@GeneratedValue`
on a field of type `Long` (preferable the object, not the scalar `long`, as literal `null` is the better indicator whether an instance is new or not):

.Mutable MovieEntity with internal Neo4j id
====
[source,java]
----
@Node("Movie")
public class MovieEntity {

	@Id @GeneratedValue
	private Long id;

	private String name;

	public MovieEntity(String name) {
		this.name = name;
	}
}
----
====

You don't need to provide a setter for the field, SDN will use reflection to assign the field, but use a setter if there is one.
If you want to create an immutable entity with an internally generated id, you have to provide a _wither_.

.Immutable MovieEntity with internal Neo4j id
====
[source,java]
----
@Node("Movie")
public class MovieEntity {

	@Id @GeneratedValue
	private final Long id; // <.>

	private String name;

	public MovieEntity(String name) { // <.>
		this(null, name);
	}

	private MovieEntity(Long id, String name) { // <.>
		this.id = id;
		this.name = name;
	}

	public MovieEntity withId(Long id) { // <.>
		if (this.id.equals(id)) {
			return this;
		} else {
			return new MovieEntity(id, this.title);
		}
	}
}
----
<.> Immutable final id field indicating a generated value
<.> Public constructor, used by the application and Spring Data
<.> Internally used constructor
<.> This is a so-called _wither_ for the `id`-attribute.
It creates a new entity and set's the field accordingly, without modifying the original entity, thus making it immutable.
====

You either have to provide a setter for the id attribute or something like a _wither_, if you want to have

* Advantages: It is pretty clear that the id attribute is the surrogate business key, it takes no further effort or configuration to use it.
* Disadvantage: It is tied to Neo4js internal database id, which is not unique to our application entity only over a database lifetime.
* Disadvantage: It takes more effort to create an immutable entity

[[mapping.id-handling.external-id]]
=== Use externally provided surrogate keys

The `@GeneratedValue` annotation can take a class implementing `org.springframework.data.neo4j.core.schema.IdGenerator` as parameter.
SDN provides `InternalIdGenerator` (the default) and `UUIDStringGenerator` out of the box.
The latter generates new UUIDs for each entity and returns them as `java.lang.String`.
An application entity using that would look like this:

.Mutable MovieEntity with externally generated surrogate key
====
[source,java]
----
@Node("Movie")
public class MovieEntity {

	@Id @GeneratedValue(UUIDStringGenerator.class)
	private String id;

	private String name;
}
----
====

We have to discuss two separate things regarding advantages and disadvantages.
The assignment itself and the UUID-Strategy.
A https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier[universally unique identifier] is meant to be unique for practical purposes.
To quote Wikipedia:
“Thus, anyone can create a UUID and use it to identify something with near certainty that the identifier does not duplicate one that has already been, or will be, created to identify something else.” Our strategy uses Java internal UUID mechanism, employing a cryptographically strong pseudo random number generator.
In most cases that should work fine, but your mileage might vary.

That leaves the assignment itself:

* Advantage: The application is in full control and can generate a unique key that is just unique enough for the purpose of the application.
The generated value will be stable and there won’t be a need to change it later on.
* Disadvantage: The generated strategy is applied on the application side of things.
In those days most applications will be deployed in more than one instance to scale nicely.
If your strategy is prone to generate duplicates then inserts will fail as the uniqueness property of the primary key will be violated.
So while you don’t have to think about a unique business key in this scenario, you have to think more what to generate.

You have several options to roll out your own ID generator.
One is a POJO implementing a generator:

.Naive sequence generator
====
[source,java]
----
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

import org.springframework.data.neo4j.core.schema.IdGenerator;
import org.springframework.util.StringUtils;

public class TestSequenceGenerator implements IdGenerator<String> {

	private final AtomicInteger sequence = new AtomicInteger(0);

	@Override
	public String generateId(String primaryLabel, Object entity) {
		return StringUtils.uncapitalize(primaryLabel) +
			"-" + sequence.incrementAndGet();
	}
}
----
====

Another option is to provide an additional Spring Bean like this:

.Neo4jClient based ID generator
====
[source,java]
----
@Component
class MyIdGenerator implements IdGenerator<String> {

	private final Neo4jClient neo4jClient;

	public MyIdGenerator(Neo4jClient neo4jClient) {
		this.neo4jClient = neo4jClient;
	}

	@Override
	public String generateId(String primaryLabel, Object entity) {
		return neo4jClient.query("YOUR CYPHER QUERY FOR THE NEXT ID") // <.>
			.fetchAs(String.class).one().get();
	}
}
----
<.> Use exactly the query or logic your need.
====

The generator above would be configured as a bean reference like this:

.Mutable MovieEntity using a Spring Bean as Id generator
====
[source,java]
----
@Node("Movie")
public class MovieEntity {

	@Id @GeneratedValue(generatorRef = "myIdGenerator")
	private String id;

	private String name;
}
----
====

[[mapping.id-handling.business-key]]
=== Using a business key

We have been using a business key in the complete example's `MovieEntity` and <<mapping.complete-example.person,`PersonEntity`>>.
The name of the person is assigned at construction time, both by your application and while being loaded through Spring Data.

This is only possible, if you find a stable, unique business key, but makes great immutable domain objects.

* Advantages: Using a business or natural key as primary key is natural.
The entity in question is clearly identified and it feels most of the time just right in the further modelling of your domain.
* Disadvantages: Business keys as primary keys will be hard to update once you realise that the key you found is not as stable as you thought.
Often it turns out that it can change, even when promised otherwise.
Apart from that, finding identifier that are truly unique for a thing is hard.
