= Frequently Asked Questions

Here are a couple of more frequently asked question in addition to the ones in the <<what-is-sdn,preface>>.

[[faq.multidatabase]]
== Neo4j 4.0 supports multiple databases - How can I use them?

You can either statically configure the database name or run your own database name provider.
Bear in mind that SDN will not create the databases for you.
You can do this with the help of a https://github.com/michael-simons/neo4j-migrations[migrations tool]
or of course with a simple script upfront.

[[faq.multidatabase.statically]]
=== Statically configured

Configure the database name to use in your Spring Boot configuration like this (the same property applies of course for YML or environment based configuration, with Spring Boot's conventions applied):

[source,properties]
----
spring.data.neo4j.database = yourDatabase
----

With that configuration in place, all queries generated by all instances of SDN repositories (both reactive and imperative) and by the `ReactiveNeo4jTemplate` respectively `Neo4jTemplate` will be executed against the database `yourDatabase`.

[[faq.multidatabase.dynamically]]
=== Dynamically configured

Provide a bean with the type `Neo4jDatabaseNameProvider` or `ReactiveDatabaseSelectionProvider` depending on the type of your Spring application.

That bean could use for example Spring's security context to retrieve a tenant.
Here is a working example for an imperative application secured with Spring Security:

[source,java]
[[faq.databaseSelectionProvider]]
.Neo4jConfig.java
----
import org.neo4j.springframework.data.core.DatabaseSelection;
import org.neo4j.springframework.data.core.DatabaseSelectionProvider;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.core.Authentication;
import org.springframework.security.core.context.SecurityContext;
import org.springframework.security.core.context.SecurityContextHolder;
import org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.User;

include::../../../../src/test/java/org/springframework/data/neo4j/documentation/Neo4jConfig.java[tags=faq.multidatabase]
----

NOTE: Be careful that you don't mix up entities retrieved from one database with another database.
The database name is requested for each new transaction, so you might end up with less or more entities than expected when changing the database name in between calls.
Or worse, you could inevitably store the wrong entities in the wrong database.

[[faq.multidatabase.health]]
=== The Spring Boot Neo4j health indicator targets the default database, how can I change that?

Spring Boot comes with both imperative and reactive Neo4j https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-features.html#production-ready-health[health indicators.]
Both variants are able to detect multiple beans of `org.neo4j.driver.Driver` inside the application context and provide
a contribution to the overall health for each instance.
The Neo4j driver however does connect to a server and not to a specific database inside that server.
Spring Boot is able to configure the driver without Spring Data Neo4j and as the information which database is to be used
is tied to Spring Data Neo4j, this information is not available to the built-in health indicator.

This is most likely not a problem in many deployment scenarios.
However, if configured database user does not have at least access rights to the default database, the health checks will fail.

This can be mitigated by custom Neo4j health contributors that are aware of the database selection.

==== Imperative variant

				.filter(databaseSelection -> databaseSelection != DatabaseSelection.undecided())
                .map(DatabaseSelection::getValue)
				.map(v -> SessionConfig.builder().withDatabase(v).build())
				.orElseGet(SessionConfig::defaultConfig);

			class Tuple {
				String edition;
				ResultSummary resultSummary;

				Tuple(String edition, ResultSummary resultSummary) {
					this.edition = edition;
					this.resultSummary = resultSummary;
				}
			}

			String query =
                "CALL dbms.components() YIELD name, edition WHERE name = 'Neo4j Kernel' RETURN edition";
			Tuple health = driver.session(sessionConfig)
				.writeTransaction(tx -> {
					Result result = tx.run(query);
					String edition = result.single().get("edition").asString();
					return new Tuple(edition, result.consume());
				});

			addHealthDetails(builder, health.edition, health.resultSummary);
		} catch (Exception ex) {
			builder.down().withException(ex);
		}
	}

	static void addHealthDetails(Health.Builder builder, String edition, ResultSummary resultSummary) {
		ServerInfo serverInfo = resultSummary.server();
		builder.up()
            .withDetail(
            	"server", serverInfo.version() + "@" + serverInfo.address())
            .withDetail("edition", edition);
		DatabaseInfo databaseInfo = resultSummary.database();
		if (StringUtils.hasText(databaseInfo.name())) {
			builder.withDetail("database", databaseInfo.name());
		}
	}
}
----

This uses the available database selection to run the same query that Boot runs to check whether a connection is healthy or not.
Use the following configuration to apply it:

[[faq.multidatabase.health.imperative.config]]

----
<.> If you have multiple drivers and database selection providers, you would need to create one indicator per combination
<.> This makes sure that all of those indicators are grouped under Neo4j, replacing the default Neo4j health indicator
<.> This prevents the individual contributors showing up in the health endpoint directly

==== Reactive variant

The reactive variant is basically the same, using reactive types and the corresponding reactive infrastructure classes:

[[faq.multidatabase.health.reactive]]
[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

import org.springframework.data.neo4j.core.DatabaseSelection;
import org.springframework.data.neo4j.core.ReactiveDatabaseSelectionProvider;
import org.springframework.util.StringUtils;

public final class DatabaseSelectionAwareNeo4jReactiveHealthIndicator
    extends AbstractReactiveHealthIndicator {

	private final Driver driver;

	private final ReactiveDatabaseSelectionProvider databaseSelectionProvider;

	public DatabaseSelectionAwareNeo4jReactiveHealthIndicator(
		Driver driver,
        ReactiveDatabaseSelectionProvider databaseSelectionProvider
    ) {
		this.driver = driver;
		this.databaseSelectionProvider = databaseSelectionProvider;
	}

	@Override
	protected Mono<Health> doHealthCheck(Health.Builder builder) {
		String query =
            "CALL dbms.components() YIELD name, edition WHERE name = 'Neo4j Kernel' RETURN edition";
		return databaseSelectionProvider.getDatabaseSelection()
			.map(databaseSelection -> databaseSelection == DatabaseSelection.undecided() ?

					s -> {
						Publisher<Tuple2<String, ResultSummary>> f = s.readTransaction(tx -> {
							RxResult result = tx.run(query);
							return Mono.from(result.records())
                                .map((record) -> record.get("edition").asString())
								.zipWhen((edition) -> Mono.from(result.consume()));
						});
						return Mono.fromDirect(f);
					},
					RxSession::close
				)
			).map((result) -> {
				addHealthDetails(builder, result.getT1(), result.getT2());
				return builder.build();
			});
	}

	static void addHealthDetails(Health.Builder builder, String edition, ResultSummary resultSummary) {
		ServerInfo serverInfo = resultSummary.server();
		builder.up()
            .withDetail(
            	"server", serverInfo.version() + "@" + serverInfo.address())
            .withDetail("edition", edition);
		DatabaseInfo databaseInfo = resultSummary.database();
		if (StringUtils.hasText(databaseInfo.name())) {
			builder.withDetail("database", databaseInfo.name());
		}
	}
}

----

And of course, the reactive variant of the configuration. It needs two different registry cleaners, as Spring Boot will
wrap existing reactive indicators to be used with the non-reactive actuator endpoint, too.

[[faq.transactions.cluster]]
== Do I need specific configuration so that transactions work seamless with a Neo4j Causal Cluster?

No, you don't.
SDN uses Neo4j Causal Cluster bookmarks internally without any configuration on your side required.
Transactions in the same thread or the same reactive stream following each other will be able to read their previously changed values as you would expect.

[[faq.bookmarks]]
== Can I retrieve the latest Bookmarks or seed the transaction manager?

As mentioned briefly in <<migrating.bookmarks>>, there is no need to configure anything with regard to bookmarks.
It may however be useful to retrieve the latest bookmark the SDN transaction system received from a database.
You can add a `@Bean` like `BookmarkCapture` to do this:

[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
.BookmarkCapture.java
----
import java.util.Set;

import org.neo4j.driver.Bookmark;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationListener;

public final class BookmarkCapture
	implements ApplicationListener<Neo4jBookmarksUpdatedEvent> {

	@Override
	public void onApplicationEvent(Neo4jBookmarksUpdatedEvent event) {
		// We make sure that this event is called only once,
		// the thread safe application of those bookmarks is up to your system.
		Set<Bookmark> latestBookmarks = event.getBookmarks();
	}
}
----

For seeding the transaction system, a customized transaction manager like the following is required:

[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
.BookmarkSeedingConfig.java
----
import java.util.Set;
import java.util.function.Supplier;

import org.neo4j.driver.Bookmark;
import org.neo4j.driver.Driver;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.data.neo4j.core.DatabaseSelectionProvider;
import org.springframework.transaction.PlatformTransactionManager;

@Configuration
public class BookmarkSeedingConfig {

	@Bean
	public PlatformTransactionManager transactionManager(
			Driver driver, DatabaseSelectionProvider databaseNameProvider) { // <.>

		Supplier<Set<Bookmark>> bookmarkSupplier = () -> { // <.>
			Bookmark a = null;
			Bookmark b = null;
			return Set.of(a, b);
		};

		Neo4jBookmarkManager bookmarkManager =
			Neo4jBookmarkManager.create(bookmarkSupplier); // <.>
		return new Neo4jTransactionManager(
			driver, databaseNameProvider, bookmarkManager); // <.>
	}
}
----
<.> Let Spring inject those
<.> This supplier can be anything that holds the latest bookmarks you want to bring into the system
<.> Create the bookmark manager with it
<.> Pass it on to the customized transaction manager

WARNING: There is *no* need to do any of these things above, unless your application has the need to access or provide
         this data. If in doubt, don't do either.

[[faq.annotations.specific]]
== Do I need to use Neo4j specific annotations?

No.
You are free to use the following, equivalent Spring Data annotations:

[cols="4*",options="header"]
|===

|SDN specific annotation
|Spring Data common annotation
|Purpose
|Difference

|`org.springframework.data.neo4j.core.schema.Id`
|`org.springframework.data.annotation.Id`
|Marks the annotated attribute as the unique id.
|Specific annotation has no additional features.

|`org.springframework.data.neo4j.core.schema.Node`
|`org.springframework.data.annotation.Persistent`
|Marks the class as persistent entity.
|`@Node` allows customizing the labels

|===

[[faq.ids.assignment]]
== How do I use assigned ids?

Just use `@Id` without `@GeneratedValue` and fill your id attribute via a constructor parameter or a setter or _wither_.
See this https://medium.com/neo4j/neo4j-ogm-and-spring-data-neo4j-a55a866df68c[blog post] for some general remarks about finding good ids.

[[faq.ids.externally]]
== How do I use externally generated ids?

We provide the interface `org.springframework.data.neo4j.core.schema.IdGenerator`.
Implement it in any way you want and configure your implementation like this:

[source,java]
.ThingWithGeneratedId.java
----
@Node
public class ThingWithGeneratedId {

	@Id @GeneratedValue(TestSequenceGenerator.class)
	private String theId;
}
----

If you pass in the name of a class to `@GeneratedValue`, this class must have a no-args default constructor.
You can however use a string as well:

[source,java]
.ThingWithIdGeneratedByBean.java
----
@Node
public class ThingWithIdGeneratedByBean {

	@Id @GeneratedValue(generatorRef = "idGeneratingBean")
	private String theId;
}
----

With that, `idGeneratingBean` refers to a bean in the Spring context.
This might be useful for sequence generating.

NOTE: Setters are not required on non-final fields for the id.

[[template-support]]
== Do I have to create repositories for each domain class?

No.
Have a look at the <<sdn-building-blocks, SDN building blocks>> and find the `Neo4jTemplate` or the `ReactiveNeo4jTemplate`.

Those templates know your domain and provide all necessary basic CRUD methods for retrieving, writing and counting entities.

This is our canonical movie example with the imperative template:

[source,java]
[[imperative-template-example]]
.TemplateExampleTest.java
----
include::../../../../src/test/java/org/springframework/data/neo4j/documentation/spring_boot/TemplateExampleTest.java[tags=faq.template-imperative-pt1]
@DataNeo4jTest
include::../../../../src/test/java/org/springframework/data/neo4j/documentation/spring_boot/TemplateExampleTest.java[tags=faq.template-imperative-pt2]
----

And here is the reactive version, omitting the setup for brevity:

[source,java]
[[reactive-template-example]]
.ReactiveTemplateExampleTest.java
----
include::../../../../src/test/java/org/springframework/data/neo4j/documentation/spring_boot/ReactiveTemplateExampleTest.java[tags=faq.template-reactive-pt1]
@DataNeo4jTest
include::../../../../src/test/java/org/springframework/data/neo4j/documentation/spring_boot/ReactiveTemplateExampleTest.java[tags=faq.template-reactive-pt2]
----

Please note that both examples use `@DataNeo4jTest` from Spring Boot.

[[faq.custom-queries-with-page-and-slice]]
== How do I use custom queries with repository methods returning `Page<T>` or `Slice<T>`?

While you don't have to provide anything else apart a `Pageable` as a parameter on derived finder methods
that return a `Page<T>` or a `Slice<T>`, you must prepare your custom query to handle the pageable.
<<custom-queries-with-page-and-slice-examples>> gives you an overview about what's needed.

[[custom-queries-with-page-and-slice-examples]]
[source,java]
.Pages and Slices
----
import org.springframework.data.domain.Pageable;
import org.springframework.data.neo4j.repository.Neo4jRepository;
import org.springframework.data.neo4j.repository.query.Query;

public interface MyPersonRepository extends Neo4jRepository<Person, Long> {

    Page<Person> findByName(String name, Pageable pageable); // <.>

    @Query(""
        + "MATCH (n:Person) WHERE n.name = $name RETURN n "
        + "ORDER BY n.name ASC SKIP $skip LIMIT $limit"
    )
    Slice<Person> findSliceByName(String name, Pageable pageable); // <.>

    @Query(
    	value = ""
            + "MATCH (n:Person) WHERE n.name = $name RETURN n "
            + "ORDER BY n.name ASC SKIP $skip LIMIT $limit",
        countQuery = ""
            + "MATCH (n:Person) WHERE n.name = $name RETURN count(n)"
    )
    Page<Person> findPageByName(String name, Pageable pageable); // <.>
}
----
<.> A derived finder method that creates a query for you.
    It handles the `Pageable` for you.
    You should use a sorted pageable.
<.> This method uses `@Query` to define a custom query. It returns a `Slice<Person>`.
    A slice does not know about the total number of pages, so the custom query
    doesn't need a dedicated count query. SDN will notify you that it estimates the next slice.
    The Cypher template must spot both `$skip` and `$limit` Cypher parameter.
    If you omit them, SDN will issue a warning. The will probably not match your expectations.
    Also, the `Pageable` should be unsorted and you should provide a stable order.
    We won't use the sorting information from the pageable.
<.> This method returns a page. A page knows about the exact number of total pages.
    Therefore, you must specify an additional count query.
    All other restrictions from the second method apply.

[[faq.path-mapping]]
== Can I map named paths?

A series of connected nodes and relationships is called a "path" in Neo4j.
Cypher allows paths to be named using an identifier, as exemplified by:

[source,cypher]
----
p = (a)-[*3..5]->(b)
----

or as in the infamous Movie graph, that includes the following path (in that case, one of the shortest path between two actors):

[[bacon-distance]]
[source,cypher]
.The "Bacon" distance
----
MATCH p=shortestPath((bacon:Person {name:"Kevin Bacon"})-[*]-(meg:Person {name:"Meg Ryan"}))
RETURN p
----

Which looks like this:

image::bacon-distance.png[]

We find 3 nodes labeled `Person` and 2 nodes labeled `Movie`. Both can be mapped with a custom query.
Assume there's a node entity for both `Person` and `Movie` as well as `Actor` taking care of the relationship:


[source,java]
."Standard" movie graph domain model
----
@Node
public final class Person {

	@Id @GeneratedValue
	private final Long id;

	private final String name;

	private Integer born;

	@Relationship("REVIEWED")
	private List<Movie> reviewed = new ArrayList<>();
}

@RelationshipProperties
public final class Actor {

	@Id @GeneratedValue
	private final Long id;

	@TargetNode
	private final Person person;

	private final List<String> roles;
}

@Node
public final class Movie {

	@Id
	private final String title;

	@Property("tagline")
	private final String description;

	@Relationship(value = "ACTED_IN", direction = Direction.INCOMING)
	private final List<Actor> actors;
}
----

When using a query as shown in <<bacon-distance>> for a domain class of type `Person` like this

[source,java]
----
interface PeopleRepository extends Neo4jRepository<Person, Long> {
    @Query(""
        + "MATCH p=shortestPath((bacon:Person {name: $person1})-[*]-(meg:Person {name: $person2}))\n"
        + "RETURN p"
    )
    List<Person> findAllOnShortestPathBetween(@Param("person1") String person1, @Param("person2") String person2);
}
----

it will retrieve all people from the path and map them.
If there are relationship types on the path like `REVIEWED` that are also present on the domain, these
will be filled accordingly from the path.

WARNING: Take special care when you use nodes hydrated from a path based query to save data.
If not all relationships are hydrated, data will be lost.

The other way round works as well. The same query can be used with the `Movie` entity.
It then will only populate movies.
The following listing shows how todo this as well as how the query can be enriched with additional data
not found on the path. That data is used to correctly populate the missing relationships (in that case, all the actors)

[source,java]
----
interface MovieRepository extends Neo4jRepository<Movie, String> {

    @Query(""
        + "MATCH p=shortestPath(\n"
        + "(bacon:Person {name: $person1})-[*]-(meg:Person {name: $person2}))\n"
        + "WITH p, [n IN nodes(p) WHERE n:Movie] AS x\n"
        + "UNWIND x AS m\n"
        + "MATCH (m) <-[r:DIRECTED]-(d:Person)\n"
        + "RETURN p, collect(r), collect(d)"
    )
    List<Movie> findAllOnShortestPathBetween(@Param("person1") String person1, @Param("person2") String person2);
}
----

The query returns the path plus all relationships and related nodes collected so that the movie entities are fully hydrated.

The path mapping works for single paths as well for multiple records of paths (which are returned by the `allShortestPath` function.)

TIP: Named paths can be used efficiently to populate and return more than just a root node, see <<custom-query.paths>>.


[[faq.custom-queries-and-custom-mappings]]
== Is `@Query` the only way to use custom queries?

No, `@Query` is *not* the only way to run custom queries.
The annotation is comfortable in situations in which your custom query fills your domain completely.
Please remember that SDN 6 assumes your mapped domain model to be the truth.
That means if you use a custom query via `@Query` that only fills a model partially, you are in danger of using the same
object to write the data back which will eventually erase or overwrite data you didn't consider in your query.

So, please use repositories and declarative methods with `@Query` in all cases where the result is shaped like your domain
model or you are sure you don't use a partially mapped model for write commands.

What are the alternatives?

* <<projections.sdn.general-remarks,Projections>> might be already enough to shape your *view* on the graph: They can be used to define
  the depth of fetching properties and related entities in an explicit way: By modelling them.
* If your goal is to make only the conditions of your queries *dynamic*, then have a look at the <<core.extensions.querydsl, `QuerydslPredicateExecutor`>>
  but especially our own variant of it, the `CypherdslConditionExecutor`. Both <<sdn-mixins,mixins>> allow adding conditions to
  the full queries we create for you. Thus, you will have the domain fully populated together with custom conditions.
  Of course, your conditions must work with what we generate. Find the names of the root node, the related nodes and more
  <<custom-queries,here>>.
* Use the http://neo4j-contrib.github.io/cypher-dsl/current/[Cypher-DSL] via the `CypherdslStatementExecutor` or the `ReactiveCypherdslStatementExecutor`.
  The Cypher-DSL is predestined to create dynamic queries. In the end, it's what SDN uses under the hood anyway. The corresponding
  mixins work both with the domain type of a repository itself as well as with projections (something that the mixins for adding
  conditions don't).

If you think that you can solve your problem with a partially dynamic query or a full dynamic query together with a projection,
please jump back now to the chapter <<sdn-mixins, about Spring Data Neo4j Mixins>>.

Otherwise, please read up on two things: <<repositories.custom-implementations,custom repository fragments>>
the <<sdn-building-blocks,levels of abstractions>> we offer in SDN 6.

Why speaking about custom repository fragments now?

* You might have more complex situation in which more than one dynamic query is required, but the queries still belong
  conceptually in a repository and not in the service layer
* Your custom queries return a graph shaped result that fits not quite to your domain model
  and therefore the custom query should be accompanied by a custom mapping as well
* You have the need for interacting with the driver, i.e. for bulk loads that should not go through object mapping.

Assume the following repository _declaration_ that basically aggregates one base repository plus 3 fragments:

The additional interface from which the repository extends (`DomainResults`, `NonDomainResults` and `LowlevelInteractions`)
are the fragments that addresses all the concerns above.

=== Using complex, dynamic custom queries but still returning domain types

The fragment `DomainResults` declares one additional method `findMoviesAlongShortestPath`:

[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
[[domain-results]]
.DomainResults fragment
----
include::../../../../src/test/java/org/springframework/data/neo4j/documentation/repositories/custom_queries/MovieRepository.java[tags=domain-results]
----

This method is annotated with `@Transactional(readOnly = true)` to indicate that readers can answer it.
It cannot be derived by SDN but would need a custom query.
This custom query is provided by the one implementation of that interface.
The implementation has the same name with the suffix `Impl`:

[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
[[domain-results-impl]]
.A fragment implementation using the Neo4jTemplate
----
include::../../../../src/test/java/org/springframework/data/neo4j/documentation/repositories/custom_queries/MovieRepository.java[tags=domain-results-impl]
----
<.> The `Neo4jTemplate` is injected by the runtime through the constructor of `DomainResultsImpl`. No need for `@Autowired`.
<.> The Cypher-DSL is used to build a complex statement (pretty much the same as shown in <<faq.path-mapping,path mapping>>.)
    The statement can be passed directly to the template.

The template has overloads for String-based queries as well, so you could write down the query as String as well.
The important takeaway here is:

* The template "knows" your domain objects and maps them accordingly
* `@Query` is not the only option to define custom queries
* They can be generated in various ways
* The `@Transactional` annotation is respected

=== Using custom queries and custom mappings

Often times a custom query indicates custom results.
Should all of those results be mapped as `@Node`? Of course not! Many times those objects represents read commands
and are not meant to be used as write commands.
It is also not unlikely that SDN 6 cannot or want not map everything that is possible with Cypher.
It does however offer several hooks to run your own mapping: On the `Neo4jClient`.
The benefit of using the SDN 6 `Neo4jClient` over the driver:

* The `Neo4jClient` is integrated with Springs transaction management
* It has a fluent API for binding parameters
* It has a fluent API exposing both the records and the Neo4j type system so that you can access
  everything in your result to execute the mapping

Declaring the fragment is exactly the same as before:

[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
[[non-domain-results]]
.A fragment declaring non-domain-type results
----
include::../../../../src/test/java/org/springframework/data/neo4j/documentation/repositories/custom_queries/MovieRepository.java[tags=non-domain-results]
----
<.> This is a made up non-domain result. A real world query result would probably look more complex.
<.> The method this fragment adds. Again, the method is annotated with Spring's `@Transactional`

Without an implementation for that fragment, startup would fail, so here it is:

[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
[[non-domain-results-impl]]
.A fragment implementation using the Neo4jClient
----
include::../../../../src/test/java/org/springframework/data/neo4j/documentation/repositories/custom_queries/MovieRepository.java[tags=non-domain-results-impl]
----
<.> Here we use the `Neo4jClient`, as provided by the infrastructure.
<.> The client takes only in Strings, but the Cypher-DSL can still be used when rendering into a String
<.> Bind one single value to a named parameter. There's also an overload to bind a whole map of parameters
<.> This is the type of the result you want
<.> And finally, the `mappedBy` method, exposing one `Record` for each entry in the result plus the drivers type system if needed.
    This is the API in which you hook in for your custom mappings

The whole query runs in the context of a Spring transaction, in this case, a read-only one.

==== Low level interactions

Sometimes you might want to do bulk loadings from a repository or delete whole subgraphs or interact in very specific ways
with the Neo4j Java-Driver. This is possible as well. The following example shows how:

[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
[[low-level-interactions]]
.Fragments using the plain driver
----
include::../../../../src/test/java/org/springframework/data/neo4j/documentation/repositories/custom_queries/MovieRepository.java[tags=lowlevel-interactions]
----
<.> Work with the driver directly. As with all the examples: There is no need for `@Autowired` magic. All the fragments
    are actually testable on their own.
<.> The use case is made up. Here we use a driver managed transaction deleting the whole graph and return the number of
    deleted nodes and relationships

This interaction does of course not run in a Spring transaction, as the driver does not know about Spring.

Putting it all together, this test succeeds:

[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
[[custom-queries-test]]
.Testing the composed repository
----
include::../../../../src/test/java/org/springframework/data/neo4j/documentation/repositories/custom_queries/CustomQueriesIT.java[tags=custom-queries-test]
----

As a final word: All three interfaces and implementations are picked up by Spring Data Neo4j automatically.
There is no need for further configuration.
Also, the same overall repository could have been created with only one additional fragment (the interface defining all three methods)
and one implementation. The implementation would than have had all three abstractions injected (template, client and driver).

All of this applies of course to reactive repositories as well.
They would work with the `ReactiveNeo4jTemplate` and `ReactiveNeo4jClient` and the reactive session provided by the driver.

If you have recurring methods for all repositories, you could swap out the default repository implementation.

[[faq.custom-base-repositories]]
== How do I use custom Spring Data Neo4j base repositories?

Basically the same ways as the shared Spring Data Commons documentation shows for Spring Data JPA in <<repositories.customize-base-repository>>.
Only that in our case you would extend from

[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
[[custom-base-repository]]
.Custom base repository
----
include::../../../../src/test/java/org/springframework/data/neo4j/integration/imperative/CustomBaseRepositoryIT.java[tags=custom-base-repository]
----
<.> This signature is required by the base class. Take the `Neo4jOperations` (the actual specification of the `Neo4jTemplate`)
    and the entity information and store them on an attribute if needed.

In this example we forbid the use of the `findAll` method.
You could add methods taking in a fetch depth and run custom queries based on that depth.
One way to do this is shown in <<domain-results>>.

To enable this base repository for all declared repositories enable Neo4j repositories with: `@EnableNeo4jRepositories(repositoryBaseClass = MyRepositoryImpl.class)`.

[[faq.entities.auditing]]
== How do I audit entities?

All Spring Data annotations are supported.
Those are

* `org.springframework.data.annotation.CreatedBy`
* `org.springframework.data.annotation.CreatedDate`
* `org.springframework.data.annotation.LastModifiedBy`
* `org.springframework.data.annotation.LastModifiedDate`

<<auditing>> gives you a general view how to use auditing in the bigger context of Spring Data Commons.
The following listing presents every configuration option provided by Spring Data Neo4j:

[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
.Enabling and configuring Neo4j auditing
----
include::../../../../src/test/java/org/springframework/data/neo4j/integration/imperative/AuditingIT.java[tags=faq.entities.auditing]
----
<.> Set to true if you want the modification data to be written during creating as well
<.> Use this attribute to specify the name of the bean that provides the auditor (i.e. a user name)
<.> Use this attribute to specify the name of a bean that provides the current date. In this case
    a fixed date is used as the above configuration is part of our tests

The reactive version is basically the same apart from the fact the auditor aware bean is of type `ReactiveAuditorAware`,
so that the retrieval of an auditor is part of the reactive flow.

In addition to those auditing mechanism you can add as many beans implementing `BeforeBindCallback<T>` or `ReactiveBeforeBindCallback<T>`
to the context. These beans will be picked up by Spring Data Neo4j and called in order (in case they implement `Ordered` or
are annotated with `@Order`) just before an entity is persisted.

They can modify the entity or return a completely new one.
The following example adds one callback to the context that changes one attribute before the entity is persisted:

[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
.Modifying entities before save
----
include::../../../../src/test/java/org/springframework/data/neo4j/integration/imperative/CallbacksIT.java[tags=faq.entities.auditing.callbacks]
----

No additional configuration is required.

[[faq.find-by-example]]
== How do I use "Find by example"?

"Find by example" is a new feature in SDN.
You instantiate an entity or use an existing one.
With this instance you create an `org.springframework.data.domain.Example`.
If your repository extends `org.springframework.data.neo4j.repository.Neo4jRepository` or `org.springframework.data.neo4j.repository.ReactiveNeo4jRepository`, you can immediately use the available `findBy` methods taking in an example, like shown in <<find-by-example-example>>

[source,java]
[[find-by-example-example]]
.findByExample in Action
----
Example<MovieEntity> movieExample = Example.of(new MovieEntity("The Matrix", null));
Flux<MovieEntity> movies = this.movieRepository.findAll(movieExample);

movieExample = Example.of(
	new MovieEntity("Matrix", null),
	ExampleMatcher
	    .matchingAny()
        .withMatcher(
        	"title",
        	ExampleMatcher.GenericPropertyMatcher.of(ExampleMatcher.StringMatcher.CONTAINING)
        )
);
movies = this.movieRepository.findAll(movieExample);
----

[[faq.spring-boot.sdn]]
== Do I need Spring Boot to use Spring Data Neo4j?

No, you don't.
While the automatic configuration of many Spring aspects through Spring Boot takes away a lot of manual cruft and is the recommended approach for setting up new Spring projects, you don't need to have to use this. 

The following dependency is required for the solutions described above:

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>{neo4jGroupId}</groupId>
	<artifactId>{artifactId}</artifactId>
	<version>{spring-data-neo4j-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

The coordinates for a Gradle setup are the same.

To select a different database - either statically or dynamically - you can add a Bean of type `DatabaseSelectionProvider` as explained in <<faq.multidatabase>>.
For a reactive scenario, we provide `ReactiveDatabaseSelectionProvider`.

[[faq.sdn-without-spring-boot]]
=== Using Spring Data Neo4j inside a Spring context without Spring Boot

We provide two abstract configuration classes to support you in bringing in the necessary beans: `AbstractNeo4jConfig` for imperative database access and `AbstractReactiveNeo4jConfig` for the reactive version.
They are meant to be used with `@EnableNeo4jRepositories` and `@EnableReactiveNeo4jRepositories` respectively. 
See <<bootless-imperative-configuration>> and <<bootless-reactive-configuration>> for an example usage.
Both classes require you to override `driver()` in which you are supposed to create the driver.

To get the imperative version of the <<neo4j-client,Neo4j client>>, the template and support for imperative repositories, use something similar as shown here:

[source,java]
[[bootless-imperative-configuration]]
.Enabling Spring Data Neo4j infrastructure for imperative database access
----
import org.neo4j.driver.Driver;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.EnableTransactionManagement;

import org.springframework.data.neo4j.config.AbstractNeo4jConfig;
import org.springframework.data.neo4j.core.DatabaseSelectionProvider;
import org.springframework.data.neo4j.repository.config.EnableNeo4jRepositories;

@Configuration
@EnableNeo4jRepositories
@EnableTransactionManagement
class MyConfiguration extends AbstractNeo4jConfig {

    @Override @Bean
    public Driver driver() { // <.>
        return GraphDatabase.driver("bolt://localhost:7687", AuthTokens.basic("neo4j", "secret"));
    }

    @Override
    protected Collection<String> getMappingBasePackages() {
        return Collections.singletonList(Person.class.getPackage().getName());
    }

    @Override @Bean // <.>
    protected DatabaseSelectionProvider databaseSelectionProvider() {

        return DatabaseSelectionProvider.createStaticDatabaseSelectionProvider("yourDatabase");
    }
}
----
<.> The driver bean is required.
<.> This statically selects a database named `yourDatabase` and is *optional*.

The following listing provides the reactive Neo4j client and template, enables reactive transaction management and discovers Neo4j related repositories:

import org.springframework.data.neo4j.repository.config.EnableReactiveNeo4jRepositories;
import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.EnableTransactionManagement;

@Configuration
@EnableReactiveNeo4jRepositories
@EnableTransactionManagement
class MyConfiguration extends AbstractReactiveNeo4jConfig {

    @Bean
    @Override
    public Driver driver() {
        return GraphDatabase.driver("bolt://localhost:7687", AuthTokens.basic("neo4j", "secret"));
    }

    @Override
    protected Collection<String> getMappingBasePackages() {
        return Collections.singletonList(Person.class.getPackage().getName());
    }
}

[[faq.sdn-in-cdi-2.0]]
=== Using Spring Data Neo4j in a CDI 2.0 environment

For your convenience we provide a CDI extension with `Neo4jCdiExtension`.
When run in a compatible CDI 2.0 container, it will be automatically be registered and loaded through https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/ext/basics/spi.html[Java's service loader SPI].

The only thing you have to bring into your application is an annotated type that produces the Neo4j Java Driver:

[source,java]
[[cdi-driver-producer]]
.A CDI producer for the Neo4j Java Driver
----
import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.enterprise.inject.Disposes;
import javax.enterprise.inject.Produces;

import org.neo4j.driver.AuthTokens;
import org.neo4j.driver.Driver;
import org.neo4j.driver.GraphDatabase;

public class Neo4jConfig {

    @Produces @ApplicationScoped
    public Driver driver() { // <.>
        return GraphDatabase
            .driver("bolt://localhost:7687", AuthTokens.basic("neo4j", "secret"));
    }

    public void close(@Disposes Driver driver) {
        driver.close();
    }

    @Produces @Singleton
    public DatabaseSelectionProvider getDatabaseSelectionProvider() { // <.>
        return DatabaseSelectionProvider.createStaticDatabaseSelectionProvider("yourDatabase");
    }
}
----
<.> Same as with plain Spring in <<bootless-imperative-configuration>>, but annotated with the corresponding CDI infrastructure.
<.> This is *optional*. However, if you run a custom database selection provider, you _must_ not qualify this bean.

If you are running in a SE Container - like the one https://weld.cdi-spec.org[Weld] provides for example, you can enable the extension like that:

[source,java]
[[cdi-driver-producer-se]]
.Enabling the Neo4j CDI extension in a SE container
----
import javax.enterprise.inject.se.SeContainer;
import javax.enterprise.inject.se.SeContainerInitializer;

import org.springframework.data.neo4j.config.Neo4jCdiExtension;

public class SomeClass {
    void someMethod() {
        try (SeContainer container = SeContainerInitializer.newInstance()
                .disableDiscovery()
                .addExtensions(Neo4jCdiExtension.class)
                .addBeanClasses(YourDriverFactory.class)
                .addPackages(Package.getPackage("your.domain.package"))
            .initialize()
        ) {
            SomeRepository someRepository = container.select(SomeRepository.class).get();
        }
    }
}
