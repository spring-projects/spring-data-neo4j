/**
 * An internally used CDI {@link Qualifier} to mark all beans produced by our
 * {@link Neo4jCdiConfigurationSupport configuration support} as built in. When the
 * {@link Neo4jCdiExtension Spring Data Neo4j CDI extension} is used, you can opt in to
 * override any of the following beans by providing a
 * {@link jakarta.enterprise.inject.Produces @Produces} method with the corresponding
 * return type:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link org.springframework.data.neo4j.core.convert.Neo4jConversions}</li>
 * <li>{@link org.springframework.data.neo4j.core.DatabaseSelectionProvider}</li>
 * <li>{@link org.springframework.data.neo4j.core.Neo4jOperations}</li>
 * </ul>
 * The order in which the types are presented reflects the usefulness over overriding such
 * a bean. You might want to add additional conversions to the mapping or provide a bean
 * that dynamically selects a Neo4j database. Running a custom bean of the template or
 * client might prove useful if you want to add additional methods.
