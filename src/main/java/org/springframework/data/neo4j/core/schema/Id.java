/**
 * This annotation is included here for completeness. It marks an attribute as the primary
 * id of a node entity. It can be used as an alternative to
 * {@link org.springframework.data.annotation.Id} and it may provide additional features
 * in the future.
 * <p>
 * To use assigned ids, annotate an arbitrary attribute of your domain class with
 * {@link org.springframework.data.annotation.Id} or this annotation:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Node
 * public class MyEntity {
 * 	&#64;Id String theId;
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * You can combine {@code @Id} with {@code @Property} with assigned ids to rename the node
 * property in which the assigned id is stored.
 * <p>
 * To use internally generated ids, annotate an arbitrary attribute of type
 * {@code java.lang.long} or {@code java.lang.Long} with {@code @Id} and
 * {@link GeneratedValue @GeneratedValue}.
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Node
 * public class MyEntity {
 * 	&#64;Id &#64;GeneratedValue Long id;
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * It does not need to be named {@code id}, but most people chose this as the attribute in
 * the class. As the attribute does not correspond to a node property, it cannot be
 * renamed via {@code @Property}.
 * <p>
 * To use externally generated ids, annotate an arbitrary attribute with a type that your
 * generated returns with {@code @Id} and {@link GeneratedValue @GeneratedValue} and
 * specify the generator class.
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Node
 * public class MyEntity {
 * 	&#64;Id &#64;GeneratedValue(UUIDStringGenerator.class) String theId;
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Externally generated ids are indistinguishable to assigned ids from the database
 * perspective and thus can be arbitrarily named via {@code @Property}.
