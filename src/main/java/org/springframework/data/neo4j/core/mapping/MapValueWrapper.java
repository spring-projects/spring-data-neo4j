 * A wrapper or marker for a Neo4j {@code org.neo4j.driver.internal.value.MapValue} that needs to be unwrapped when used
 * for properties.
 * This class exists solely for projection / filtering purposes: It allows the {@link DefaultNeo4jEntityConverter} to keep
 * the composite properties together as long as possible (in the form of above's {@code MapValue}. Thus, the key in the
 * {@link Constants#NAME_OF_PROPERTIES_PARAM} fits the filter so that we can continue filtering after binding.
