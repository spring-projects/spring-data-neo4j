/**
 * <!-- tag::intent[] -->
   The main mapping framework. This package orchestrates the reading and writing of entities and all tasks related to it.
   The only public API of this package is the subpackage {@literal callback}, containing the event support.
   The core package itself has to be considered an internal api, and we don't give any guarantees of API stability.
