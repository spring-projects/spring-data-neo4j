    <title>Performance considerations</title>
    <para>
        Although adding layers of abstraction is a common pattern in software development, each of these layers
        generally adds overhead and performance penalties. This chapter discusses the performance implications
        of using Spring Data Graph instead of the Neo4j API directly.

        <title>When is Spring Data Graph right</title>
        <para>
            The focus of Spring Data Graph is to add a convenience layer on top of the Neo4j API. This enables
            developers to get up and running with a graph database very quickly, having their domain objects
            mapped to the graph with very little work. Building on this foundation, one can later explore other,
            more efficient ways to explore and process the graph - if the performance requirements demand it.
        </para>
        <para>
            Like any other object mapping framework, the domain entities that are created, read, or persisted
            represent only a small fraction of the data stored in the database. This is the set needed for a
            certain use-case to be displayed, edited or processed in a low throughput fashion. The main advantages
            of using an object mapper in this case are the ease of use of real domain objects in your business
            logic and also with existing
            frameworks and libraries that expect Java POJOs as input or create them as results.
        </para>
        <para>
            Spring Data Graph, however, was not designed with a major focus on performance. It does add some overhead
            to pure graph operations. Something to keep in mind is that any access of properties and relationships
            will in general read through down to the database. To avoid multiple reads, it is sensible to store the
            result in a local variable in suitable scope (e.g. method, class or jsp).
        </para>
        <para>
            Most of the overhead comes from the use of the Java Reflection API, which is used to provide
            information about annotations, fields and constructors. Some of the information is already cached
            by the JVM and the library, so that only the first access gets a performance penalty.
