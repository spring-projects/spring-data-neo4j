        Now we needed to figure out how to store our chosen domain model in the chosen database.
        First we read up about graph databases, in particular our chosen one,
        <ulink url="http://neo4j.org">Neo4j</ulink>.
        The Neo4j data model consists of nodes and relationships, both of which can have key/value-style
        properties. Relationships are first-class citizens in Neo4j, meaning we can link together nodes
        into semantically rich networks. This really appealed to us. Then we found that we were also able to
        <ulink url="http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/snapshot/indexing.html">index nodes and relationships</ulink>
        by {key, value} pairs. We also found that we could traverse relationships both imperatively using
        the core API, and declaratively using a query-like
        <ulink url="http://wiki.neo4j.org/content/Traversal_Framework">Traversal Description</ulink>.
    </para>
    <para>
        We also learned that Neo4j is fully transactional and therefore upholds <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID">ACID</ulink> guarantees for our data.
        This is unusual for NOSQL databases, but easier for us to get our head around than non-transactional
        eventual consistency. It also made us feel safe, though it also meant that we had to manage transactions.
        Something to keep in mind for later.
    </para>
    <para>
        We started out by doing some prototyping with the Neo4j core API to get a feeling for that. And also
        to see, what the domain might look like when it's saved in the graph database. After adding the Maven
        dependency for Neo4j, we were ready to go.
