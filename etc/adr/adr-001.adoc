== ADR 1: Configuration of Id-Mapping

=== Status

accepted

=== Context

SDN RX needs to provide a configuration of Ids mappings.
Ids can either be internal (native Neo4j) Ids or generated Ids.

=== Decision

The configuration should not be ambiguous.
`@org.springframework.data.annotation.Id` will be used as the marker for an Id.
A _strategy_ will be used to decide whether the annotated attribute will be mapped to `id(node)` or set from the external.
The strategy will either be `internal`, `assigned` or `generated`.
`generated` will require an additional attribute of `generator`.

The internal strategy will be the default.

To configure the Id strategy, a meta-annotated `@Id` annotation will be provided through `org.neo4j.springframework.data.core.schema.Id`

=== Consequences

We are still compatible with the OGM 3.1+ approach of recommending `@Id long id;` while providing a clear direction for the user.
