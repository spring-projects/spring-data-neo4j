[abstract]
--
Spring Data Neo4j - or in short _SDN_ - is an ongoing effort to create the next generation of Spring Data Neo4j, with full reactive support and lightweight mapping.
SDN will work with immutable entities, regardless whether written in Java or Kotlin.
--

The primary goal of the https://projects.spring.io/spring-data[Spring Data] project is to make it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use new data access technologies such as non-relational databases, map-reduce frameworks, and cloud based data services.

The SDN project aims to provide a familiar and consistent Spring-based programming model for integrating with the https://neo4j.com/[Neo4j] Graph Database.

== Code of Conduct

This project is governed by the link:https://github.com/spring-projects/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md[Spring Code of Conduct].
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code of conduct.
Please report unacceptable behavior to spring-code-of-conduct@pivotal.io.

== Manual

For a gentle introduction and some getting started guides, please use our
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/neo4j/docs/current/reference/html/#reference[Manual].

== Getting Started

=== Maven configuration

==== With Spring Boot

If you are on https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot], all you have to do is to add our starter:

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>{groupIdStarter}</groupId>
	<artifactId>{artifactIdStarter}</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

and configure your database connection:

[source,properties]
----
spring.neo4j.uri=bolt://localhost:7687
spring.neo4j.authentication.username=neo4j
spring.neo4j.authentication.password=secret
----

Please have a look at our https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/neo4j/docs/current/reference/html/#reference[manual] for an overview about the architecture, how to define
mappings and more.

==== Without Spring Boot

If you are using a plain Spring Framework project without Spring Boot, please add this Maven dependency:

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>{neo4jGroupId}</groupId>
	<artifactId>{artifactId}</artifactId>
	<version>{spring-data-neo4j-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

and configure SDN for reactive database access like this:

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
@EnableReactiveNeo4jRepositories
@EnableTransactionManagement
class MyConfiguration extends AbstractReactiveNeo4jConfig {

    @Bean
    public Driver driver() {
        return GraphDatabase.driver("bolt://localhost:7687", AuthTokens.basic("neo4j", "secret"));
    }

    @Override
    protected Collection<String> getMappingBasePackages() {
        return Collections.singletonList(Person.class.getPackage().getName());
    }
}
----

The imperative version looks pretty much the same but uses `EnableNeo4jRepositories`  and `AbstractNeo4jConfig`.

IMPORTANT: We recommend Spring Boot, the automatic configuration and especially the dependency management
through the Starters in contrast to the manual work of managing dependencies and configuration.

Here is a quick teaser of a reactive application using Spring Data Repositories in Java:

[source,java]
----
@Node
public class Person {
    private Long id;
    private String name;

    public Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

@Repository
interface PersonRepository extends ReactiveNeo4jRepository<Person, Long> {

    Flux<Person> findAllByName(String name);

    Flux<Person> findAllByNameLike(String name);
}

@Service
class MyService {

    @Autowired
    private final PersonRepository repository;

    @Transactional
    public Flux<Person> doWork() {

        Person emil = new Person("Emil");
        Person gerrit = new Person("Gerrit");
        Person michael = new Person("Michael");

        // Persist entities and relationships to graph database
        return repository.saveAll(Flux.just(emil, gerrit, michael));
    }
}
----

=== Building SDN

Please have a look at the documentation: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/neo4j/reference/#building-sdn-rx[Building SDN].

== Getting Help

Having trouble with Spring Data? We’d love to help!

* Check the
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/neo4j/reference/[reference documentation], and https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/neo4j/docs/current/api/[Javadocs].
* Learn the Spring basics – Spring Data builds on Spring Framework, check the https://spring.io[spring.io] web-site for a wealth of reference documentation.
If you are just starting out with Spring, try one of the https://spring.io/guides[guides].
* If you are upgrading, check out the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-commons/wiki/#release-notes[changelog of the individual release version] for "`new and noteworthy`" features.
* Ask a question - we monitor https://stackoverflow.com[stackoverflow.com] for questions tagged with https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/spring-data-neo4j[spring-data-neo4j].
* Report bugs with Spring Data Neo4j at https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-neo4j/issues[github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-neo4j/issues].

== Reporting Issues

Spring Data uses GitHub as issue tracking system to record bugs and feature requests. If you want to raise an issue, please follow the recommendations below:

* Before you log a bug, please search the
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-neo4j/issues[issue tracker] to see if someone has already reported the problem.
* If the issue doesn't already exist, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-neo4j/issues/new[create a new issue].
* Please provide as much information as possible with the issue report, we like to know the version of Spring Data Neo4j, the database version and the JVM version that you are using.
* If you need to paste code, or include a stack trace use Markdown +++```+++ escapes before and after your text.
* If possible try to create a test-case or project that replicates the issue. Attach a link to your code or a compressed file containing your code.
